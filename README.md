The supermarket is an essential part of our daily lives. A supermarket is a self-service store that is divided into sections and offers a broad selection of food, beverages, and home items. It is larger and has a wider assortment than older grocery stores, but it is smaller and offers a narrower choice of products than a hypermarket or big-box store. Even though consumers are increasingly purchasing online, the number of supermarkets continues to grow. More and more people are focusing on one thing: speed, enjoyment, or convenience. Supermarkets are expanding in the most densely populated places, and market rivalry is intense. This dataset represents one of the historical sales of a supermarket firm, which was recorded for three months in three distinct branches. With these datasets, predictive data analytics approaches are simple to implement. The dataset contains historical sales data from three separate supermarket outlets from January to March 2019.
